# Unbeatable Tic-Tac-Toe â€” a browser game
This is a Tic-Tac-Toe game that runs in the browser, where the user plays against an unbeatable bot, that makes its moves based on the Minimax algorithm - this ensures it cannot be beaten. Ever. \
Written in HTML, CSS and vanilla Javascript

## Installation

If you have Git installed, open the terminal, navigate to the desired location of the project using `cd` and clone the repository using the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mezeirobert0/unbeatable-tic-tac-toe.git
```
Otherwise go to the remote GitHub repository (https://github.com/mezeirobert0/unbeatable-tic-tac-toe), go to `Code > Download ZIP` and unzip the folder in the desired location.

## Running the game

Open the project folder and double-click on `index.html`. \
After opening the file, the player is greeted and is asked to choose one of the sybols: X or O (keep in mind X always plays first). \
As soon as the player chooses, the greet and selection buttons become invisible and the board appears. Also, it is worth noting that the bot takes about 1 second to make a move. \
When the game is over, a result is displayed under the board:
* Player wins! - It is highly unlikely for the player to win, but I still added the option :)
* Bot wins!
* It's a draw!

Beneath the result, the selection buttons appear if the player wants to play another game.
